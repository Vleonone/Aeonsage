# Bonjour / mDNS discovery

AeonSage uses Bonjour (mDNS / DNSâ€‘SD) as a **LANâ€‘only convenience** to discover
an active Gateway (WebSocket endpoint). It is bestâ€‘effort and does **not** replace SSH or
Tailnet-based connectivity.

## Wideâ€‘area Bonjour (Unicast DNSâ€‘SD) over Tailscale

If the node and gateway are on different networks, multicast mDNS wonâ€™t cross the
boundary. You can keep the same discovery UX by switching to **unicast DNSâ€‘SD**
("Wideâ€‘Area Bonjour") over Tailscale.

Highâ€‘level steps:

1) Run a DNS server on the gateway host (reachable over Tailnet).
2) Publish DNSâ€‘SD records for `_aeonsage-gw._tcp` under a dedicated zone
   (example: `aeonsage.internal.`).
3) Configure Tailscale **split DNS** so `aeonsage.internal` resolves via that
   DNS server for clients (including iOS).

AeonSage standardizes on `aeonsage.internal.` for this mode. iOS/Android nodes
browse both `local.` and `aeonsage.internal.` automatically.

### Gateway config (recommended)

```json5
{
  gateway: { bind: "tailnet" }, // tailnet-only (recommended)
  discovery: { wideArea: { enabled: true } } // enables aeonsage.internal DNS-SD publishing
}
```

### Oneâ€‘time DNS server setup (gateway host)

```bash
aeonsage dns setup --apply
```

This installs CoreDNS and configures it to:
- listen on port 53 only on the gatewayâ€™s Tailscale interfaces
- serve `aeonsage.internal.` from `~/.aeonsage/dns/aeonsage.internal.db`

Validate from a tailnetâ€‘connected machine:

```bash
dns-sd -B _aeonsage-gw._tcp aeonsage.internal.
dig @<TAILNET_IPV4> -p 53 _aeonsage-gw._tcp.aeonsage.internal PTR +short
```

### Tailscale DNS settings

In the Tailscale admin console:

- Add a nameserver pointing at the gatewayâ€™s tailnet IP (UDP/TCP 53).
- Add split DNS so the domain `aeonsage.internal` uses that nameserver.

Once clients accept tailnet DNS, iOS nodes can browse
`_aeonsage-gw._tcp` in `aeonsage.internal.` without multicast.

### Gateway listener security (recommended)

The Gateway WS port (default `18789`) binds to loopback by default. For LAN/tailnet
access, bind explicitly and keep auth enabled.

For tailnetâ€‘only setups:
- Set `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` in `~/.aeonsage/aeonsage.json`.
- Restart the Gateway (or restart the macOS menubar app).

## What advertises

Only the Gateway advertises `_aeonsage-gw._tcp`.

## Service types

- `_aeonsage-gw._tcp` â€?gateway transport beacon (used by macOS/iOS/Android nodes).

## TXT keys (nonâ€‘secret hints)

The Gateway advertises small nonâ€‘secret hints to make UI flows convenient:

- `role=gateway`
- `displayName=<friendly name>`
- `lanHost=<hostname>.local`
- `gatewayPort=<port>` (Gateway WS + HTTP)
- `gatewayTls=1` (only when TLS is enabled)
- `gatewayTlsSha256=<sha256>` (only when TLS is enabled and fingerprint is available)
- `canvasPort=<port>` (only when the canvas host is enabled; default `18793`)
- `sshPort=<port>` (defaults to 22 when not overridden)
- `transport=gateway`
- `cliPath=<path>` (optional; absolute path to a runnable `aeonsage` entrypoint)
- `tailnetDns=<magicdns>` (optional hint when Tailnet is available)

## Debugging on macOS

Useful builtâ€‘in tools:

- Browse instances:
  ```bash
  dns-sd -B _aeonsage-gw._tcp local.
  ```
- Resolve one instance (replace `<instance>`):
  ```bash
  dns-sd -L "<instance>" _aeonsage-gw._tcp local.
  ```

If browsing works but resolving fails, youâ€™re usually hitting a LAN policy or
mDNS resolver issue.

## Debugging in Gateway logs

The Gateway writes a rolling log file (printed on startup as
`gateway log file: ...`). Look for `bonjour:` lines, especially:

- `bonjour: advertise failed ...`
- `bonjour: ... name conflict resolved` / `hostname conflict resolved`
- `bonjour: watchdog detected non-announced service ...`

## Debugging on iOS node

The iOS node uses `NWBrowser` to discover `_aeonsage-gw._tcp`.

To capture logs:
- Settings â†?Gateway â†?Advanced â†?**Discovery Debug Logs**
- Settings â†?Gateway â†?Advanced â†?**Discovery Logs** â†?reproduce â†?**Copy**

The log includes browser state transitions and resultâ€‘set changes.

## Common failure modes

- **Bonjour doesnâ€™t cross networks**: use Tailnet or SSH.
- **Multicast blocked**: some Wiâ€‘Fi networks disable mDNS.
- **Sleep / interface churn**: macOS may temporarily drop mDNS results; retry.
- **Browse works but resolve fails**: keep machine names simple (avoid emojis or
  punctuation), then restart the Gateway. The service instance name derives from
  the host name, so overly complex names can confuse some resolvers.

## Escaped instance names (`\032`)

Bonjour/DNSâ€‘SD often escapes bytes in service instance names as decimal `\DDD`
sequences (e.g. spaces become `\032`).

- This is normal at the protocol level.
- UIs should decode for display (iOS uses `BonjourEscapes.decode`).

## Disabling / configuration

- `AEONSAGE_DISABLE_BONJOUR=1` disables advertising.
- `gateway.bind` in `~/.aeonsage/aeonsage.json` controls the Gateway bind mode.
- `AEONSAGE_SSH_PORT` overrides the SSH port advertised in TXT.
- `AEONSAGE_TAILNET_DNS` publishes a MagicDNS hint in TXT.
- `AEONSAGE_CLI_PATH` overrides the advertised CLI path.
