## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

AeonSage is structured as a modular operating system. Understanding the layers will help you contribute effectively.

| Directory | Layer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/kernel/` | **Core (Ring 0)** | The deterministic state machine and identity verification. |
| `src/router/` | **Cognitive (Ring 1)** | Logic dispatching, prompt synthesis, and tool binding. |
| `src/skills/` | **Extensions (Ring 2)** | Isolated capability modules (Web Search, File Ops). |
| `ui/` | **Interface** | The React-based control dashboard. |

## 🤝 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Reporting Issues
We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and requests.
*   **Bugs**: Please include reproduction steps and logs.
*   **Security**: Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Email `security@velonlabs.com`.

### 2. Feature Proposals (RFCs)
For significant changes, we recommend opening a [Discussion](https://github.com/velonone/Aeonsage/discussions) first. This ensures alignment on architecture before you write code.

### 3. Pull Request Process
1.  **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch (`feat/new-skill-xyz`).
2.  **Commit** your changes using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    *   `feat: add discord voice support`
    *   `fix(kernel): resolve memory leak in router`
3.  **Sign Your Work (DCO)**: All commits must serve as a Developer Certificate of Origin.
    ```bash
    git commit -s -m "feat: description"
    ```
4.  **Open PR**: Provide a clear description of the problem and solution.

## 🤖 AI Policy

We embrace AI-assisted development. Code generated by LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Cursor) is welcome, provided it meets our quality standards.

*   **Review Requirement**: You are responsible for the correctness of the code. Verify all logic manually.
*   **Transparency**: Please tag your PR with `[AI-Assisted]` to help reviewers focus on logic validation.
